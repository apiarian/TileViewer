<div> 
<p>A demonstration of the TileViewer jQuery plugin.  It displays large images that have been precut into tiles.  This lets the user look at the large image in the browser without having to download it all in one go.  It behaves similarly to Google Maps</p>
<p>If you don't see anything, you should probably update your browser.  The latest Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera should work well enough.  Internet Explorer is not really supported since it cannot handle the HTML5 canvas element.  This page has been tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on Mac OS X 10.6.</p>
